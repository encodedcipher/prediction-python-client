Python
    This was developed with Python 2.6.6, so no gurantees for older versions.
           

prediction.py
    This abstracts the REST calls to the Prediction API and provides a few helper 
    functions for Google Storage.
    
examples
    fetch_auth.py
        Fetch the authorization token using your Google account.  
        If you specify only your email and password a new auth token is returned.
        If you specify a .boto file and the token is already in the file, the 
        value in the file is returned.
        If you specify the keyword argument newtoken=True, a new token is generated,
        written to the .boto file, and returned.  This requires a valid value for botoconfig.
            
    train_model.py
        Using your authorization token, train the model using 
        your bucket and data in Google Storage.  It validates
        the token and the verifies the existence of the resources
        in Google Storage.
        
    is_training_complete.py
        Demonstrate how to make periodic calls to see if training is complete.
        
    predict.py
        Submit a prediction and get the results.
        
    delete_model.py
        Delete an existing model.
